# work-day-scheduler

## Project Description
A schedule application designed to be used to plan a work day. Hours range from 9AM to 5PM. When the page is opened, the application checks for the current time and the color of each hour block is dynamically changed to show whether they are in the past, present, or future. The application uses localStorage to save notes so that they persist within a browser.
